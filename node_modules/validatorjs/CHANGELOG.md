* Added asynchronous validation `registerAsync()` and pass callbacks to `passes(func)` and `fails(func)`.

* Errors must now be accessed by `.errors.get('username')` or `.errors.first('username')` rather than `.errors.username`.

* Added ability to format attributes `.setAttributeFormatter(function)` (by default replaces all _[] with spaces.)
* Added ability to set custom attribute names to display in errors `.setAttributeNames()`.
